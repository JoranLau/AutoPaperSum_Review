There are 2 approaches that this group uses to accomplish their project.

The first one is using TextRank to conduct the summary of a input file. 
The other one is using training text to train a model by using Machine Learning process, 
such as Recurrent Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory.

In the sprint 2, the project uses Word2Vec to pre-process the texts that being tested, by 
segmenting them into sentences, which is very convenient for following work. After that,
it uses TextRank API to simply pick out the highest ranking sentences in the graph generated
from previous work. By selecting this approach is very convenient when simply devide the text
and give it a analysis. 

The other approch is to use a Machine Learning process. By using Recurrent Neural Network,this 
allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior for a time sequence.RNNs can use their internal 
state  to process sequences of inputs. This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, 
connected handwriting recognition or speech recognition, which is suitable for this project.
